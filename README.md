## Scope of the Project.

This is a recap of what we've done so far. The aim is to carry out a detailed analysis requirement for a client project. the first part of the assignment is done using **a uml design  tool**.

## When the code was written.

The code was written Monday the 29th October. 2018 during an exercise at the _Becode coding academy_. The for the compeltion of the project is still to follow..
 
## Coding journey.

Since creating the **uml** flow there hasn't been any significant changes in my professional career. This is due to the fact I'm still a student at the said academy.

The code is not yet written. Mentor assessments will determine subsequent changes to the project. 

## Content

The code consist of basic 
1. A uml file showing the flow of the design.
2. A wireframe of the proposed design
3. This code is just a simple web page and does not contain any executable file.

## Origin

The code was written as part of an assignment in class.
